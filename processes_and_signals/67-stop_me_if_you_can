# Stops the running '7-highlander' process without using kill or killall.

# pkill finds processes by name and sends a signal (SIGTERM by default).
# We search for the exact filename to ensure only the target process is signaled.
pkill -f "./7-highlander"

# The '-f' flag tells pkill to match against the full command line.
# Running this script sends SIGTERM, which 7-highlander catches and responds to.
