#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Kills the running '7-highlander' process using the SIGKILL signal.

# The 7-highlander script traps SIGTERM (signal 15).
# To force termination, we must use SIGKILL (signal 9), which cannot be trapped.

# pkill -9 finds the process by name and sends signal 9 (SIGKILL).
pkill -9 -f "./7-highlander"

# -f: Match against the full command line.
# -9: Specify the SIGKILL signal.
