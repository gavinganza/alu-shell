# Stops the running '4-to_infinity_and_beyond' process without using kill or killall.

# pkill finds processes by name and sends a signal (SIGTERM by default).
# We search for the exact filename to ensure only the target process is stopped.
pkill -f "./4-to_infinity_and_beyond"

# The '-f' flag tells pkill to match against the full command line,
# ensuring we accurately target the running script.
